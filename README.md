# python_projects
My different python projects, starting from 2nd semester into the computer technology bachelor. Most of the projects was made on my spare time while learning python.

### Tetris

Made at the end of 2nd semester. Made with tkinter.

Made at the very start of 2nd semester, almost without functions and objects (very new to programming). This was my first big project. Used turtle graphics.
